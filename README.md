# Concurrent Ticket Reservation System

The Concurrent Ticket Reservation System is a server-client model for ticket reservation developed in Go. The server is capable of managing multiple client requests concurrently, ensuring concurrency control over both server and client connections. Additionally, a caching system has been incorporated to optimize the handling of regularly recurring requests.
