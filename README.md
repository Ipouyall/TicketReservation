# Concurrent Ticket Reservation System

The Concurrent Ticket Reservation System is a server-client model for ticket reservation developed in Go. The server is capable of managing multiple client requests concurrently, ensuring concurrency control over both server and client connections. Additionally, a caching system has been incorporated to optimize the handling of regularly recurring requests.

# Key Features

### concurrency control
In this project, we've applied concurrency control measures using mutexes to avoid race conditions and maintain data integrity. We've used mutexes to safeguard shared resources .

The `sync.Map` enables safe access for multiple Goroutines, while the `sync.RWMutex` allows either multiple readers or a single writer to access shared resources like event details. This approach guarantees that concurrent interactions with the ticket reservation system are reliable and consistent.

### client interface
The client interface in the ticket reservation system provides a user-friendly way for clients to interact with the system. It likely includes features such as displaying available events, allowing users to reserve ticket. The interface enhances the usability of the system by simplifying the process of browsing events and managing ticket reservations, ultimately improving the overall user experience.

### fairness 
Go's scheduler ensures fair scheduling of Goroutines, preventing any single Goroutine from monopolizing CPU resources. It employs techniques like work stealing to balance workload across CPU cores, preemptive scheduling to prevent blocking, round-robin local run queues for fair Goroutine selection, cooperative yielding with `runtime.Gosched`, priority-based scheduling, a network poller for efficient I/O, and fair mutexes to prevent starvation.


### resource managment

In Go, Goroutines  managing  typically doesn't require much effort. However, in scenarios where the number of concurrent Goroutines needs to be controlled to prevent resource exhaustion, strategies like using buffered channels, semaphores, or worker pools can be employed. Packages like `netutil` offer utilities for managing Goroutine concurrency.
